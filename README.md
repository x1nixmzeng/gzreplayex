GunZ Replay Ex
==============

A rewrite of **GunZ Replay Examiner**, which I posted to [RaGEZONE](http://forum.ragezone.com/f245/gunz-replay-examiner-714725/) in December 2010.

This version can parse all existing replay formats:

 * REC (Korean beta, ~March 2004)
 * GZR v1.0 to v11.0

There is also code to process the packet commands in GunZ 2 format - although the game is still in the beta-testing stage.


## Status

This project supports the full range of versions and game types at a basic level.

It lacks many of the features I had previously written as I lost the sourcecode and do not have the will to fully rewrite it.
